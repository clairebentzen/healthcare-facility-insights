# Healthcare Facility Insights Platform 
This repository contains the code for a comprehensive healthcare facility insights platform developed using data obtained from the Community Benefit Insight. The primary objectives of the project are to create a production-ready data pipeline that regularly updates, cleans, and analyzes hospital data. Additionally, it provides a user-friendly dashboard for stakeholders to access real-time information about healthcare facilities such as KPI and hospital capacity overview, aiding in strategic decision-making and resource allocation.
